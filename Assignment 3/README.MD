# Assignment 3  

Generate 50 data points (one-dimensional problem) with x uniform distance from (0,1) and generate y from the formula y=sin(1+x^2)+noise Where noise has (0,0.032)distribution. Divide the data into training and test (8:2). Scatter plot the y values as well as plot the noise-free true function for train and test separately.


Implement the linear and polynomial regression models using the closed form solution as taught in the class on training data and explore their effectiveness in creating a predictor that best approximates the data using test data. Calculate the RMSE error and show the test and train results with varying degrees of a polynomial regression model to fit the data.
